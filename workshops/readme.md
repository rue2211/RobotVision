workshop1_main - Harshitha

* Tasks 1A and 1B are done. 
* Task 2 is simply an extension of 1B (can add a loop to iterate over all time stamps instead of just '0', as was the case with task 1A) - so I skipped that. 
* Task 3 is something that I haven't studied the theory for in detail, but we do need it for CW1. Will do that soon. 
* Task 4 is optional.


Workshop 2 - Rudra
* Two files uploaded T1W2 and T2W2 as one is pure kalman filter and the latter is KF with clock speed
* Task 1C - optional and not done
